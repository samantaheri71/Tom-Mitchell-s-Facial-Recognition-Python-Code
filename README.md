# Tom-Mitchell-s-Facial-Recognition-Python-Code
I was reading the great Tom Mitchel's book on machine learning and I came across one of its examples which were about facial recognition using artificial intelligence. The book has provided us with C++ code, yet I thought it would be useful to write the code in Python. (I searched but could not find a Python code) So I wrote the code, and I have assumed that python will do nothing special for backpropagation learning and I wrote the code from scratch. In this manner, the code is longer and maybe harder to read. Yet, it shows a beginner how exactly the backpropagation works. Also, you should try different hyper-parameters in the code ( learning rate and epochs) to achieve desirable results.
